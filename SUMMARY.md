## Overview

This adapter is used to integrate the Itential Automation Platform (IAP) with the Salesforce System. The API that was used to build the adapter for Salesforce is usually available in the report directory of this adapter. The adapter utilizes the Salesforce API to provide the integrations that are deemed pertinent to IAP. The ReadMe file is intended to provide information on this adapter it is generated from various other Markdown files.

>**Note**: It is possible that some integrations will be supported through the Salesforce adapter while other integrations will not. If you need additional API calls, you can use the Update capabilities provided by the Adapter Builder or request Itential to add them if the Adapter is an Itential opensourced adapter.

Itential provides information on all of its product adapters in the Customer Knowledge Base. Information in the <a href="https://itential.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals" target="_blank">Customer Knowledge Base</a> is consistently maintained and goes through documentation reviews. As a result, it should be the first place to go for information.

For opensourced and custom built adapters, the ReadMe is a starting point to understand what you have built, provide the information for you to be able to update the adapter, and assist you with deploying the adapter into IAP.
